# Backend Created using FastAPI and SQLite
The backend has 2 endpoints

```/api/test```
Takes code as a string and executes it and returns all stdout data to the user

```/api/submit```
Takes code as a string and saves the code to a SQLite DB if running code does not cause errors. The Id is automatically generated by the server

# Dealing with Malicious Code
The program attempts to reduce any damages from maliciously passed code by

1. Using docker to run the passed in code in a container to ensure that the actual server's hardware is not affected
2. Allowing code to only run a specific amount of time (5 seconds in this case). If the allowed execution time is exceeded, it is treated as invalid code

# Running the backend
Install the required packages using

```pip install fastapi uvicorn sqlalchemy psycopg2-binary docker```

[You must also have Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

Run the program with ```uvicorn main:app```

It will run on ```localhost:8000``` by default
