# Frontend developed using React with Vite

The frontend consists of a code editor and two buttons. One button runs the code (test) and the other submits the code to be saved on a server. The output of the code that ran will be displayed below the editor and an error will be displayed if something went wrong

# Running the frontend

In this directory, run the following:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```
