# Frontend developed using React with Vite

The frontend consists of a code editor, two buttons and a history of submitted code. \
- One button runs the code (test) and the other submits the code to be saved on a server.
- The output of the code that ran will be displayed below the editor and an error will be displayed if something went wrong
- The user can click on previously submitted code to have it auto-filled in the editor and the output will reflect the output of the previous code

# Running the frontend

In this directory, run the following:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```
**This app built using Node v.18.18.0. There is no guarantee it will work on other versions**
